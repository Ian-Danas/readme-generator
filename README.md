## Description <a id = "Description"></a>
This project servers as a command line application to automatically generate a professional README file. The user will be asked several prompts about the project in the commands line w. once they a have alanswered tall the porrompts a file will be generated with all the information filled out in the readme file
## Installation <a id = "Installation"></a>
In order to use this command line application the user will first need to clone the the repository code onto their own machine. From there they will need to install all the dependencies included in the package.json file by running the "npm -i" in the commands line. From there they can run the index.js file in the terminal to run the program by calling the command "node index.js"
## Usage <a id = "Usage"></a>
 In the terminal they will need to answer all the questions about the project. For the github username only the username is required the rest of the github link is created by the program. The last section is for adding a license to the project. If no selection is made by simply hitting enter without making a selection the license section of the readme will be omitted. If a license is selected it will be added to the table to contents and a section will be created with a message about your selection, as well as a badge will be added to the top of the readme with the license name. Once all prompts are answered the readme file will be generated and placed in an output folder. There is a demo README in the output folder to see what the program will create.
